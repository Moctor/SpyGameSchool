This spy game challenges the player to reach the exit without being detected. Unlike typical Unity projects, all the main mechanics were implemented using mathematical calculations instead of relying on Unity’s built-in colliders. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of movement, detection systems, and game logic, while practicing custom solutions for gameplay mechanics.
